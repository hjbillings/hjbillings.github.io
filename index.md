## HJB's site

Hosted using [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/hjbillings/hjbillings.github.io/edit/main/README.md) in Markdown files with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Markdown

Markdown is a disappointment because I wanted to use HTML/CSS/Javascript but I haven't figured out how to host a site like that yet. I'm just gonna keep the list here for reference because wtf is Markdown lol.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
